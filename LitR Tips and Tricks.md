# LitR Survival - Tips

Whether or not you play in Survival Mode, the core philosophy of Life in the Ruins is *Adapt To What The World Gives You*. A lot of things you took for granted in Vanilla, like near-infinite ammo, or being able to get the perfect legendary weapon for your build, don't apply any more.

## Pacing
- Lunar Fallout Overhaul extends and rebalances the games progression. Early game lasts till around level 20-25, mid game lasts to around 50-60, and end game enemies cap out their scaling around level 100.
- The early game is significantly harder if you try to rush the main quest, don't try to go after Kellog before at level 15. Raiders are ok, but Gunners, Super Mutants, and Synths are all SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult, those are fights you will need to prepare for.

## Combat: Damage, Health and Healing
- LitR Survival is balanced for default lunar survival damage levels (1 and 1.3), but can be adjusted in the MCM to whatever you want, just make sure you've fought some synths and super mutants before tweaking (because they WILL wreck you). This is an RPG, the early game enemies are supposed to be easy.
- LitR is balanced for Strategic combat that requires resource usage, instead of tactical combat where you die and respawn constantly.
- When you do die, you should respawn at the nearest settlement you control, instead of reloading your last save. You will lose 10% of your current caps.

## Ammo    
- Lunar Fallout Overhaul moves Armor Piercing from the receiver to some ammunition calibers- these are designated with either AP or +P in the name. These will do a lot more damage to heavily armored enemies (especially Power Armor), so don't waste them.
- Use a melee weapon to conserve ammo on lower level enemies. Ammo is scarce, you will probably need to buy some at some point, so don't waste it.
- Because Ammo is scarce, don't expect to be able to use a single weapon and ignore everything else the way you can in vanilla.

## Power Armor
- Power armor is for special occasions. Fusion cores are rare enough that without some way to produce or recycle them yourself, you probably won't be able to maintain power amor 100% of the time.
- Different power armors have different niches- the T60 is weaker than the T51 for example, but cheaper to repair.
    * Raider : Cheap, easy to repair, but low protection
    * T45 : Basic military model
    * T51 : Upgraded defenses compared to the T45
    * T60 : Upgraded fuel efficiency, compared to the T45
    * X01 : Unique prototype, combining the defenses of the T51, and the fuel efficiency of the T60.

## Collectibles
- Magazines and Bobblehead locations are randomized, and you probably won't get all of them in a single playthrough.
- There are now 2 full sets of bobbleheads, Vault Boy and Vault Girl.

## Uniques
- Almost every single unique weapon and armor in the game has been replaced with a modded weapon, armor, or gadget, including the ones you can buy in shops. Some of them are very powerful end game items, so check them out when you're shopping. You will want to buy some of them now.
- If a mod is used as a Unique Replacer, then you will not find that weapon, armor, or item anywhere else in the game. That is what "Unique" means.
