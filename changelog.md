# 7.0.0 Lunar Fallout Plus

This is (yet another) major restructuring of the list, to a significantly more vanilla+ balance, letting Lunar Fallout Overhaul handle almost all of the balance.

Due to the update of MO2, you probably will need to update the C++ Redistributables https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

This is a major update, and so requires a new game.

# 6.5.0 Energy Weapon Overhaul
The big change this update is a full overhaul of energy weapons- see [Lunar Arsenal modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/81133) for details, and Patreon Supporters can check out the full [Dev Blog](https://www.patreon.com/posts/devblog-6-5-110742157) on the subject.

This update is technically save-safe, however due to all the balance changes for energy weapons, and the removed weapons, a new save is recommended. Any of the removed weapons in the existing save will be either missing or broken in an updated game- using the uniques placement runner file in the misc section of Vanilla Unique Framework will rerun the unique placement quest which should regenerate most uniques in the world, but it won't fix any you've already found/bought.

# 6.4.0 - Home Sweet Home

The major changes this update are the PRP upgrade to 7.4, and an update to Home Unimprovement. We've also got some new player home options and improvements, which should flesh out the alternatives to building your own primary base. Journey Survival Settlement Fast travel comes in, as a replacement for SS2's caravan system. I've also re-added True Storms, removed Lightweight Lighting, and swapped back to True Sight ENB.

Due to the removal of NukaWorldPlus and The Danse Dilema, I'm marking this update as not safe-safe. It may be possible to continue a save where you've not started these questlines, however I've not tested it, and don't recommend it unless you're willing to take the risk.

Of note the Home Unimprovement update is a major under-the-hood overhaul of the mod. An MCM menu is now included, to allow you to enable/disable categories of recipes, and the patch to re-enable the vanilla menu is no longer required. Barter has also had a major update, that will now randomize the time to vendor restocking, and the percentage of their goods that get restocked.

# 6.3.0 Re-Loaded Out

The major change this update, is a rework of how backpacks and encumbrance work. See the updated Load Out mod page for a detailed description. The TLDR is that the vanilla 10CW per Strength has been moved to backpacks, you get 5% per strength armor weight reduction, and Over-Encumbrance accumulates fatigue damage instead of health.

This update is save safe, however when updating an existing game 1) Backpacks that spawned in the existing game will be broken (their carry weight increase will be missing) and 2) you will probably need to reset your Carry Weight - the getAV carryWeight command should return 0 while you are not under the effects of any carryweight buffs for Load Out to function properly.

# 6.2.0 

The major feature this update is a big shuffle of the perk poster, which should finish out the major work on Perks I wanted to do.

This update is save safe, but you need to [use a mindwipe](https://discord.com/channels/885225427839369216/1234624150589407253) first

# 6.1.0 Rise of the Minutemen

The two big changes this update are the removal of Fens Sheriffs Dept, and the inclusion of a bunch of new pre-built settlement crafting, paired with You and What Army 2. I've also added a new Linked Dropbox to settlement crafting, that should make setting up a forward operating base easier. Several of the redundant uniques have been swapped out for new modded weapons that offer unique rechambers for their weapon class. 

This update is not save safe.

# 6.0 All those who Wander are not lost...

In this update, both the Settle and LunarPlus profiles have been removed. For context on this, check out the public post on my patreon. If you are playing one of those profiles and want to continue doing so, do not install this update, just keep enjoying your current game.

For those of you wanting to update an existing wander playthrough, BACK UP YOUR SAVE BEFORE INSTALLING. I've renamed the profile to a single default Life in the Ruins profile, and this will result in wabba deleting your saves if you don't back them up outside the LitR directory. Also, you need to uninstall Knockout Framework from the MCM before updating.

    * Swapped Le Fusil Riot for Pipe Revolver Shotgun

# 5.4.3 QoL

Just a few minor QoL changes I didn't have time to get into 5.4.2, primarily some vendor buy/sell price tweaks (stuff should be more affordable, and your junk is worth more, to the right merchant), and default survival setting tweaks to make sleeping easier on the Wander profile.

    * Updated perk descriptions for perks that affect degredation rate



# 5.4.0 Degrade & Salvage V2

The big changes this update are some shuffling of perks, and changes to the crafting systems. I've also done a decent amount of under the hood work on the progression of weapons within the pack, see Lunar Fallout Arsenal and the Degrade and Salvage mod pages for details.

Also note, that Rifleman now works for "manual-action rifles and shotguns", and commando "full and semi-auto rifles and shotguns", (yes, this means the vanilla laser rifle is now under commando).

Summary of Crafting Changes
Weapons
- Attachments (mags/scopes/muzzles) are still swappable, but the "body" of the weapon (reciever/barrel/grip) are no longer swappable. 
- Barrels/Grips are now only craftable on pipe/handmade weapons. 
- Recievers are crafted with Weapon Scrap parts that are obtained by scrapping the weapon (make sure to pull off any attachments you want first)
- weapons that have degraded have an extra "repair" recipe added to them that allows the player to craft a replacement reciever even if they don't have the perks normally required. 
- Paints are no longer craftable.
- Scrapper is no longer a crafting perk
- Melee weapons are no longer modifyable.

Power Armor
- Now uses the swappable mod system (like weapons attachents)
- repair perk requirement has been moved from Armorer to Blacksmith.

These changes are made to further encourage the explore/loot gameplay loops, and get players out of the boring menus that this game uses as an excuse for a crafting system. And to create more of a niche for pipe style weapons within the game.

This update is save-safe if you use a mindwipe before updating (console 'help mindwipe', then use the formId from that with 'player.addItem'). There will potentially be a few broken weapons if you migrate an existing save, but these can safely be fixed with console commands (Including Wastelander's Friend and Problem Solver, due to the removal of their base weapon mod), or just ignored, it won't hurt your save. You will also need to rebuild any power armor repair stations (they have to be reset to pick up the changed crafting requirements).

This update is compiled against the latest version of FO4. This means that you need to update your game to install the update. LitR will create a downgraded copy of FO4 in the stock game folder as part of the installation.

# 5.3.0 Load Out & Lock Up

The major changes this update,are [Load Out](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/78015) replacing the old backpacks balance mod, the return of Locky Bastard and a new Hacking Minigame bypass option that uses Mentats. See Through Scopes has been enabled for supporting weapons. This update also shuffles some of the unique armor sets around, and introduces set bonuses for them.

This update is not save safe, primarily due to the game setting changes required to get Load Out working properly on companions, and also due to the renaming of profiles, which will cause loss of save games.

# 5.2.2 New Year, New Profiles

This update marks the launch of the Wander and LunarPlus profiles.

 Wander is an alternate profile based around Start Me Up, Player Undead Death Recovery, and Home Unimprovement instead of SS2. The wander profile also has support for the Steam Deck (because that's what I'm playing it on currently). As such, this update includes quite a few new mods in the main list that I wanted for Wander, primarily as part of trying to keep these profiles in sync as much as possible.

 LunarPlus is a more vanilla+ profile, with a lot of the survival focussed gameplay changes I've made over the years disabled. So, no Stimpacked, No Feast and Famine, No True Perks, etc. The idea is to just let LFO be LFO, with a bunch of extra weapons and quests.

# 5.2.0 And then there were 3...

Big change this update is the shift from 4 health segments down to 3. This should make resource management around healing a little more forgiving. After updating, the healing system should re-sync to the 3 segments, but if you experience any weirdness, healing from a doctor should reset the system fully.

This update also includes an update to the Unique Replacers Project that swaps the legendary omods on Uniques over to new unique omods that are copies of the vanilla (or lunar) effect. This will not have any noticeable effect in game, and will only affect new games, but in the long term makes targetted tweaks to the balance of individual Uniques possible.

This update is save-safe, however updating an existing game will cause the following Vendor Uniques to loose their legendary effects: Vengence, Honor, and the Wastelander's Collar.

# 5.1.0 Video Killed the Radio Star

Two major mods are removed in this update. First is True Storms, which is removed for compatibility reasons with Lightweight Lighting - I don't want to have to maintain compatibility between multiple weather mods. Before running the update, just make sure that in the MCM settings for True Storms settings -> Enable True Storms Effects -> Off, and save the game in an interior cell. The second is More Where That Came From, which seems to have been completely removed from the nexus, rendering the list uninstallable until I remove it. If you want to keep it around, just add a [NODELETE] tag.

This update is save safe as long as you follow the instructions above.

# 5.0.2 A few more uniques

    CREATION CLUB USERS BACKUP YOUR SAVES BEFORE THIS UPDATE - they're stored in the profiles folder inside your litr installation. I've removed the seperate creation club profile, it's now been integrated into the default profile, if you are using the creation club paint jobs, copy your saves from the cc profile folder into a folder outside the litr install, update, then paaste the saves into the saves folder in the main profile, and enable the [CC] tagged mods for them- they can be at the end of the load order.

    The main update here are a few new Unique Replacers and the SS2 update. This is save-safe to update, however the changed uniques will need to have their mods fixed at the weapons bench.

# 5.0 - Praxinator Gets Upstaged

Praxinator over on the discord has been doing some work on consistency, bugfixes, and sorting for the modlist. Big thanks to him, for doing things I have neither the time or patience to do. But I'm guessing most of you are here for SS2 chpt 3, and not that. This release also marks the modlist moving from active development into maintenance. As such, there are a lot of changes around making the list more maintanable in the long run. Also coming in are a few new content mods I've had had on my todo list for a while. A lot of mods have also come out, either due to precombine issues, or general tone/quality. My goal is that this will be the last major content update for the list.

In other news, I've decided to remove Locky Bastard and Ultimate Hacking- they end up devaluing the perks because players who have mastered the minigames just skip the perks, and the removal of the level gate on higher level content is problematic (e.g. LBPACs changes to Power Armor Obtainability, and Lunar's level gating of loot). I've added lock/terminal bypassing to the perks instead.

PRPX has been replaced for the full PRP. This is accompanied by the removal of several quest and content mods that had precombine issues.

New Settings - With the new MCM settings manager, I'm shipping a LitR default settings that need to be loaded when starting a new game. I've also swapped the list over to use Rootbuilder for managing ENB and ENBoost - see the updated readme sections for details. Users wanting to use a seperate ENB should also have a much easier time of it now.

This requires a new game if updating from 4.x

Users updating from one of the 5.0 prereleases should enable Immersive Hud in the optional section (it's been moved to the optional section, and disabled by default). Also make sure that you're enabling one of the ENBoost presets (I've added root builder, to make managing that easier), and loading the MCM settings in MCM Settings Manager.

# 4.4.0 Stimpacked

The big change this patch is the new Stimpacked health overhaul mod. It changes the way health and healing work, I recommend checking out the modpage. Alongside it is an update to Feast and Famine that removes healing from drinking water and replaces it with an AP buff, as well as new mods for removing healing on levelup, and the potential for interruptions while trying to sleep in unprotected areas (which has some nice synergy with sofa surfer and the new healing changes).

The other large change is the removal of Diamond City Expansion. The mod is just too heavy on performance, in addition to balance issues. Also coming out in this update is the SS2 plans pack - this is due to memory issues with having to much in script memory- I recommend only downloading and installing plans you want to use. If you're using plans in the pack and want to update, add a [NODELETE] tag before doing so. I've also pulled a few other mods, in an effort to generally improve maintainability, and reduce the amount of custom conflict resolution I have to do.

I recommend starting a new game for this update if you've already visited Diamond City. However as long as you're not in the middle of a DCE quest it shouldn't corrupt your save to remove DCE as it's not a scripted mod, no promises though.

# 4.3.3 - Economics of the Post Apocalypse

The major change this update is the new mod Barter - Vendor Restrictions, which reworks what you can and can't sell to vendors, and the amount of caps they have.

This update is save safe, although if you've recruited the NPCs from the remove "Recruit" mods, you should tag that mod with a [NODELETE] prior to updating.

# 4.3.2 - More bugfixes

This update is save safe, unless you've recruited Kat and Gus- if you have, I recommend you add a [NoDelete] tag to the recruit kat and gus as settlers mods before updating.

# 4.3.1 - Just a little update

I've done some rebalancing of the ballistic weaves, leather weaves are more protective, combat weaves are craftable without joining the BoS and can be found on Gunners, and a few outfits have been tweaked. Full body suits that weight > 20 lbs no longer qualify for Gumshoe02 or Dressed for the Apocalypse (if it's that heavy, it's armor). Expect Gunners to be even harder than they already were.

For anyone on the pre-release, I've decided to push the economy changes off for now, until they can be tested more thoroughly.

# 4.3.0 - Stop saying LitR doesn't have enough weapons Part III
The big add this patch is a bunch of new weapons and armor, most of which are coming in as replacers for the Vendor Aspirationals, aka, the legendaries you can buy from vendors. This is save game safe, however getting the new purchaseable uniques requires a new game (in an existing game, the base item will be replaced, but the mods on it won't so it will be weird, but in most cases can be fixed at a workbench by changing the mods out).

I've also done some refinement on the new weapon crafting. There's a wider variety of "attachment" components (screws, adhesive, lead, etc), and they're more varied based on weapon and attachment point. The number of adhesive and screws required have been reduced.  At the same time, the scrapper perk has been reworked so that it functions more like scrounger- you find more in containers, rather than having a near infinite source of rare components, but it also now allows you to find uncommon and rare weapon components.

# 4.2.0 - Weapon Crafting and Degredation

The big thing this update, in addition to a bunch of shuffling and updating of the weapons, is a completely new system for weapon mods crafting: Weapon Component Crafting And Receiver Degredation. Pipe weapons are mostly unchanged, however pre-war weapon mods can no longer be crafted from scratch components. They instead have to be scavenged- however weapon mods now scrap to components, e.g. the misc mod "10mm Short Scope" now scraps to a "Short Scope" component- and you can take that component, and a couple of screws, and attach it to ANY weapon that can have a short scope, not just another 10mm. Coming along with this new system is a new degredation mechanic for any weapon with a Receiver. Receivers will now degrade over time- every time they're fired the weapon has a small chance for the receiver to degrade down a level, unless the player has either Gun Nut or Science.

The effect of these new systems, should be that the player needs to engage more in looting and scavenging, to upgrade and maintain their weapons. This also means that players who choose to not take the crafting perks can still upgrade Unique weapons by finding compatible parts.

Updating an existing save is possible, none of the removed mods have scripts, but the uniques with changed replacers will be broken in an existing game (and require fixing at a crafting bench). However, due to the scale of balance changes around crafting, you may want to start an new game anyway.

# 4.1.1 - Power Armor Cleanup
The main feature here is my new LBPAC redux, which merges a handful of smaller PA Tweaks mods together, and improved the player feedback for the mods Fusion Core drain changes and perk repair requirements. I've also opted to include Glitchfinder's Who's the General, so players doing the minutemen questline should notice changes in how Preston hands you quests.

This update is save safe from 4.1.0.

# 4.1.0 - 

If updating an existing save, you need to run the following console command
player.setvalue level x
where x = your level / 100
So, a level 5 player should use 0.05

Additionally, if updating an existing save I recommend adding a [NODELETE] tag to the Makeshift SMG and the Lunar patch for it before updating.

# 4.0.0 - A Big Update

The big new thing here is of course the Fens Sheriff's Dept. I've also have some new crafting overhauls: Feast & Famine, which is my rebuild of the food and cooking systems, and True Perks Diversified Crafting, which overhauls weapon and armor crafting. We also have a big update to Unique NPCs Creatures, which removes Radspiders, as well as a few other things. They may return as a separate mod in a future version of the list, but for now, I've de-merged them out of UNCPs. We also have a new Lighting and ENB setup.

This is a major update, that removes quite a few mods.
- Several outdated/broken weapons
- See Through Scopes (I know this one will be contraversial, but having some weapons support it and other not is confusing so I'm removing it - it is safe to add back, and the replacer version doesn't require any conflict resolution other than my lunar patch to do so- feel free to put it back if you want it). 
- A few of the SS2 addon packs - due primarily to wanting to tighten up the options there, and not overload newer players with too much too quickly
- Cross Armors - They diverge from vanilla too much, both in asthetic and in mechanics
- Broken Settlement mods

# 3.2.3

Minor update, with mostly bug fixes and a roll back of the food changes, they need more polishing before they're ready, if you want to help test them I'll have a pre-release up soon with them. But for now they're coming out of the main list

# 3.2.2 Happy Anniversary

LitR turns 1 year old today, and so we're celebrating with some bug fixes, and a couple new mods.

Food crafting and values have recieved an overhaul, it's suggested to turn SCM hunger and thirst from calculated by weight, back to the default calculated by value within the MCM.

Healing values in Food Doesn't Stack have also been tweaked, food and water should have noticeable but slow healing, active only outside of combat.
I've finally worked out the issues I was having with food healing, the TLDR is that in order to update the spell you have to remove and reapply it, users updating the list should run the following commands
- help food 4 spell
- player.removeSpell idFromFirstCommand
- player.addSpell idFromFirstCommand

Other things of note are changes to some of the workshop recipes. Lunar adds crafting perks to a bunch of recipes, generators, tables, etc, that with the recent changes in True Perks that makes those perks hard to get makes those recipes a pain- most of those recipes have now been reverted to their vanilla requirements. I've also added recipes to dissassemble pieces from guns, which should make playthroughs without gunnut more viable.

# 3.2.1 : The cure for the common cold

So, I came down with a cold this week, and it got me thinking about the survival diseases are a terrible gameplay mechanic, no real player interaction, just random punishment which you just ignore until you happen to be near a doctor again, so it's getting disabled. No survival diseases disables the effects of the disease, but you might still get notifications about contracting those - if you want just disable the mechanic in the SCM MCM menu to remove the notifications. A future update may include some new illness options for survival, but that's likely a ways away still.

# 3.2 - The Alias Project and True Perks

A couple big changes here. First, Creative Perks Plus has been upgraded to True Perks, it's a major version change. I've also added my new Alias Project, which is a scripted replacer for True Legendary Enemies Redux. Players who want the full normal enemy renaming features can just disable the legendary modules (all it does is change the distribution of the spell, it's safe to toggle mid save). I've also swapped out some of the older sound mods for some updated on, updated a bunch of stuff, as well as some general new content additions.

All this means that I have to recommend against updating an existing save. If you want to try it anyway, I recommend taking a couple steps.
1 Make a backup of your save, and put it somewhere you won't lose it. If you encounter weirdness later, you can always grab the 3.1.1 release from my Patreon (the file isn't paywalled), and roll back.
Adrenaline Rush has been swapped out for my own custom integration in True Perks Survival, which changes adrenaline to be a mostly AP based effect

you need to stop Adrenaline Rush.
1. help adrenaline 4 NOTE
2. player.addItem (id from step 1)
3. Use the uninstall option on the holotape you just gave yourself

Once you're in game after updating, I also recommend respeccing your perks. You can now do so with the new mindwipe chem, purchasable from vendors, or just cheat one in for yourself
1. help mindwipe 4 alch
2. player.addItem (id from step 1)
3. Use the chem, it'll remove all your existing perks

# 3.1.0 - Immersive Legendary Mutations Release

Due to the removal of True Legendary Enemies, Recruit Darla, and the update for Nobodys Leaders, a new save is recommended. If you want to try updating an existing save, I would suggest doing so on a save where you've not recruited Darla.

- Misc

    * Repacked texture archives with the 2k HD Overhaul Museum Wall fix

# 3.0.4 - The Downgrade-ening

Just a minor update, with a couple hotfixes, and a bunch of texture repacking.
A few texture mods have been removed, they were initially included due to the Fallout 4 HD Overhaul not covering weapons or robot actors, but should be no longer needed. The Fallout4 HD Overhaul has been swapped out for the 2k version, and some overriding textures have been downgraded to 2k. This should be a pretty significant performance improvement for most users.
I've also repacked a bunch of the mod added weapons, this should free up around 50 ba2 slots, let me know if you encounter any issues with missing weapon textures.

I suggest removing the downloads for the old 4K HD Overhaul, and the mods in the removed section, should save you about 60gb of hd space

# 3.0.2 Happy Halloween from Ug Qualtoth
 
 A couple of spooky additions, a bunch of updates and bugfixes, and another Fallout 4 HD Overhaul update (so expect some time downloading and repacking archives).

 Also, includes my new Companion weapon swap script, which allows you to upgrade the hidden companion weapon, by equipping them with a weapon of the same type.

 I did a bunch more cleanup on the custom patches, so you'll get a warning about missing plugins, however as those patches didn't add or remove anything, this update is still save safe.

# 3.0.0 Stop complaining that LitR doesn't have enough Weapons Part II : Reign of the Uniques

    The primary feature this release is my Unique Replacer project, which replaces all the uniques in the game with actual unique weapons from the nexus. 
    
    Ammo scarcity has also been tweaked - ammo drops should be slightly more generous, but picking up weapons no longer grants ammo. 
    
    Carry Weight has also recieved an overhaul - Pocketed armor modification have been disabled, and replaced with Backpacks as the primary source of carry weight benefits.

    Syringer Ammo and the Chemist perk has also been overhauled, new syringer ammos added by SRO have been removed, and crafting for syringer ammo in general has been standardized, and requires a new Empty Syringe item.

    With the addition of the Cryolance, and the Archimedes II, I suggest grabbing Neiro's Skinpacks for them from Gumroad
    https://niero.gumroad.com/

    Patreons updating from the prerelease should go to Drumlin Diner, and disable Doc Drumlin by activating the med kit there, before updating.

Another update, another "final version" of the Fallout 4 HD Overhaul, another 50gb of textures to download...

# 2.1.0 Someone Tell Luxor to Stop Updating...

Update includes Fourville, and some new weapons, as well as a bunch of other new stuff and minor content.

This update includes yet another "final" update to Fallout 4 HD Overhaul, which means another 50gb of downloads. For those of you without nexus premium, I'm sorry.

Due to changes around Uniques, and the removal of Eli's Armor Compendium, and some general cleanup of levelled lists, a new game is recommended.

If you want to update an existing save, find an interior cell, set the game to a non-survival setting, wait 10 days, and set the game back to survival. This should reset all partially cleared cells. Due to the removal of Eli's Armor Compendium, you might still see some naked NPCs (settlers, a few companions), just give them some clothes.

A new game is required for changes to the unique weapons to take effect. In an existing game, If you want, you can disable Unique Uniques Vanilla Legendaries Mod (if you don't existing unique weapons mods will lose their special abilities, but the weapons won't gain the legendary attachments, nothing will break, but you might be sad).

# 2.0.1.1 Hotfix

This is a hotfix try and address the recuring infinite loading screen issue some users have been having. I believe the root cause was related to vsync settings and windowed mode for users, possibly interacting with GSync/FreeSync settings. It also includes a hotfix for Workshop Framework that was preventing some SS2 quests from progressing.

This also includes a swap to using the standard system game INI files, instead of profile ones. It's caused confusion in the past, and makes it harder to optimise your settings and update the list, and may have contributed to the ILS issues. See the (readme)[https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus#readme] for settings recommendations.

# 2.0.0 Stop complaining this list needs more weapons
This update is a major overhaul of weapons, Power Armor, and their distribution. A new game is strongly recommended (due to the scale of the changes to weapon and power armor distribution, and the removal of VUWR-R).

To update an existing game (Not recommended, but it is possible possible) make a clean save (go into an interior cell, update, set game to non-survival, wait 3 days, turn the game back to survival). This should reset all cells, and allow you to find the new weapons in the world. Due to the removal of VUWR, and the addition of Unique Uniques, unique weapons will be missing their mods, however unique uniques should detect this, and add the missing mods.

Recommended - Go download the Cross Break Action Laser Skins from [Neiro's Gumroad](https://niero.gumroad.com/l/fhdhdh)

Warning - This update includes the final update from the Fallout 4 HD Overhaul mod, which means about 40gb of downloads are required.

This update adds a LOT of new BSAs. If you find yourself CTDing when starting or loading a game, it's because you've hit the limit, and need to repack and combine some of them to get beneath the limit. The creation club content is particularly problematic here, because of how many archives it has. I'll be experimenting with repacking the texture mods into the main game archives, however that will require more time and testing before it's ready.

# 1.1.3 
This update is safe safe if you haven't started the Nuka-World Quest or visited Nuka-World. If you have, I recommend either not updating, or manually rolling back Nuka-World Plus to version 0.995.

This update removes the M2019, and the 10mm SMG. Make sure to unequip any you are carrying before updating. Both guns are below the quality of what I'd like in the list, and swapping to the split LFO patch game me the chance to remove these. I won't be replacing them directly, but have plans for a few more weapons additions.

This update includes changes to aid items and disease curing. Each disease is now cured by one chem/drug, antibiotics now only cures infection.

# 1.0.3 - Provisioners and Power Armor
This update brings big changes to Survival Fast Travel, and to power armor.
_This update is save-safe as long as you are not using a city plan from Rise of the Commonwealth, if you are it is recommended to switch to a different plan before updating, as they have been removed due to being buggy._

- Survival fast travel has been removed from the explorer perk, and added to the Local Leader perk (the 2nd rank now allows you to fast travel by talking with your provisioners). The fast travel version of the explorer perk is still available in the optional section, if you've already taken explorer 2, 3 or 4 I recommend enabling.
- Power Armor health now matters, damaged power armor will protect you significantly less than power armor in full repair, keep an eye on it's condition with the new stats widget.
- If you want to randomize the bobblehead locations in your existing save, go stand on the entrance to Vault 111.
- Stats for various clothing with railroad weave have been changed, so they have lower stats, but spawn with an undercoat. Unfortunatly, this means if you already have them, you will just get the lower stats.
