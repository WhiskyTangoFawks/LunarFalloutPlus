# Life In The Ruins: A Lunar Fallout Plus Modlist
## Bem Vindo Ao Apocalipse

From the author of Creative Perks Plus, a Fallout 4 modlist for a survival playthrough without the grind, based on Lunar Fallout Overhaul and Sim Settlements 2. Designed to deepen and enhance the existing game, without straying too far from the vanilla asthetic.

## Modlist Goals
- RPG Balance, Scaling, and Progression - brought to you by Lunar Fallout Overhaul.
- Survival Mechanics, with non-survival damage levels and balance.
- A vibrant, forested, inhabited, but still uncivilised wasteland. Neglected areas should feel fleshed out, but it should still feel lonely.
- Increased variety in Creatures, Weapons and Armors by mods that add variety to existing content, rather than mods that add a ton of new unbalanced items and monsters
- Extra high-quality content with the same style and tone as vanilla (no pointlessly skimpy outfits, no tacti-cool weapons).
- Full controller support (no extra configuration required).
- Smooth performance on mid-range gaming hardware
 
 ### This is not...
- a hardcore, nitty-gritty survival simulator - if you want that go play a Horizon based list.
- a twitch shooter - if you want that, go play one of the Better Locational Damage based lists.
- Fallout New Vegas - if you want that, go play Fallout New Vegas.
- an "everything but the kitchen sink" list with every mod out there - if you want that, go play Magnum Opus.
- a super-difficult make-the-game-impossible list for people who've played FO4 100x and know it like the back of their hand
- a good base-list for building on top of - if you want that try Welcome to Paradise or Fusion

### [Full List of Mods at LoadOrderLibrary](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/life-in-the-ruins-2)
 
## Things you should know...
- Check out the [LitR Survival Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/LitR%20Tips%20and%20Tricks.md)
- Perks have increasing SPECIAL requirements, and specials can be trained past 10.
- Crafting requirements have been completely overhauled, Gun Nut and Armorer are no longer the only perk you'll need to craft.
- Power armour is more powerful, but rare, and fusion cores are harder to come by and won't always be full. You also don't get to keep the T45 you find in Concord, other power armor frames will be fine though. Repairing PA now [requires perks](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/62273)
- Shoot/Kick/Explode locks open. Read the nexus page for [LockyBastard](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13380).
- Survival fast travel is available early game by taking the Local Leader Perk and building a provisioner network, or later on by building the SS2 Caravan plot. If you want an easier fast travel just enable it fully via unlimited survival.
- You don't need to stimpack your companions after combat, the survival requirement to use a stimpack to get them up is disabled.
- The [SS2 Triangle of Death](https://simsettlements.com/site/index.php?threads/understanding-ctds-in-the-triangle-of-death-sanctuary-abernathy-farm-and-red-rocket.6964/) is still a problem, and always will be. Do not heavily develop more than one of those three settlements.


### Technical Requirements
- This modlist must be installed on an SSD (the wabbajack download folder can be on an HDD though).
- This modlist requires at least 6gb of Vram.

The modlist is designed for relatively modern, middle range hardware. A high end graphics card is not required, but it does help (I am currently playing with a 6500xt on the medium preset, and FPS is mostly capped above 90 outside of Diamond City and Boston Commons, where it does drop for me).

#### If you have less than 6gb of vram or the list otherwise performs badly for you
- Do not try to run the list above 1080p, 1440 in fallout is a performance killer
- Reducing the grass density/diversity by editting the ini file in the True Grass mod
- Disable the ENB (press * to show FPS, then press shift + F12 to disable ENB processing to see if it makes a difference).

Some or all of these tweaks may allow the list to run better below the minimum requirements.

## Wabbajack Installation
See [How to Wabbajack](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/How%20To%20Wabbajack.md) for detailed instructions on using wabbajack to install the modlist
 
*This is a large modlist, with several large downloads, including several large sets of textures. Nexus Premium is __highly__ recommended for the initial download, expect the initial download and installation to take at least an hour with premium.*

- HD DLC is NOT required, however because this modlist uses a stock game folder, rather than your game folder in steam, if you do have the HD DLC installed Life in the Ruins will ignore it.

### Solving Common Wabbajack Installation Problems
* Set your game language to English if you have the game in another language- the installer does not work in other languages (it needs to find and copy the base game video files)
* Verify you game files in steam, then run the game through steam, then repeat the installation
  
## Additional Setup (post wabbajack installation)
### Customisation
1. Pick your Profile: "Life in the Ruins", or "Life in the Ruins - CreationClubPaints" if you have the required set of creation club paint jobs
    -  Creation Club Profile - Copy the creation club files from your `fallout4/data directory` into a new mod folder named, for example, `[NODELETE] CreationClub Paint Jobs` mod folder. 
    - If you CTD immediately on load on the Creation Club profile, but not on the regular profile, then you've hit your BSA limit, and need to repack the creation club content, [see here for more details](https://github.com/WhiskyTangoFawks/LunarFalloutPlus/blob/main/CreationClubContent.md)
2. (Recommended) Download and install into a new mod folder named something like `[NODELETE] Cross Skin Packs`, placed at the bottom of the load order, the following skin packs from https://gumroad.com/niero. They're available for free (use the discount code), but a donation is suggested. The man makes some fantastic mods, and you can probably afford to buy him a coffee. The links for the 2k version are provided below, however the 4k are also available.
    * [Break Action Laser Skin Pack](https://niero.gumroad.com/l/fhdhdh)
    * [Cross Cryolance](https://niero.gumroad.com/l/mQKCt)
    Not following this step will result in the alternate skins for these mods being very low res.
3. The `Difficulty and Customisation` section in Mod Organizer - for people who want to tweak thing a little.
    * `[NODELETE] Cross Skin Packs` : the downloaded cross skins go here
    * `Lunar Survival Damage`: If you want an easier or harder damage in survival, this lets you adjust in in the MCM.
    * `Lucky 7 - Hardcore Start`: You get 7 points to spend at start, and get an extra perk point every 7 levels. For players who want a real challenge.
    * `QoL Tweaks` : Minor quality of life tweaks, disable any you don't want
    * `Classic Holstered Weapons` : Recommended to enable it, seems fine for most users but in rare cases some users have had problems with the game freezing during combat using it, so it's in the optional section.
    * `Food Healing Doesn't Stack` : Instead of directly healing you, food fills a buffer, that very slowly heals you over time, as a result, eating 12 steaks doesn't heal you faster than a stimpak.
    * `Abandoned Hub` : A mod that gives you a cheaty underground hub settlement, connected to fast travel points scattered throughout the world
    * `Start Me Up - Skip Pre-War Prologue` Optional mod that allows you to skip the pre-war prologue
    * `Uneducated Shooter`: Recommended to only enable this after character creation, as it is known to cause a game freeze during new games.
    * `120FPS No VSYNC` : If you run a high refresh rate monitor with GSync/FreeSync, this will disable vsync, and cap the framerate at 120.

### Game INI Settings with BethINI
How to Setup your own ini files with Bethini
1. Close Mod Organizer, and open BethINI from the `Tools` folder inside your LitR installation
2. `Setup` tab 
    * Check that the game path is pointing to the `Stock Game Folder`, and not your steam installation
    * Check that the mod organizer path is pointing to the correct instance of MO2 for Life in the Ruins.
    * Check that your game settings path is set to `my documents/my games/fallout 4`
3. `Basic` Tab
    * Choose a profile at least one step lower than you would use for vanilla fallout. For most users with less than a 3090 I recommend medium or high, LitR is significantly heavier than vanilla fallout. (The shorter draw distances on medium make A Forest much easier to run, and A Forest makes it so you can see stuff way in the distance anyway)
    * For most users, 1920x1080 resolution is recommended.
    * Enable `VSync` unless you're using Gsync/FreeSync (the `High FPS Physics Fix` mod controls VSync and this settings should be ignored, but having it match here doesn't hurt)
    * On the custom tab, select `general` in the section drop down, and `iNumHWThreads` in the settings drop down. Set this to the number of cores your CPU has, doubling that number if it has hyperthreading. For more information on this setting, see https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/Guide:Skyrim_INI/General#iNumHWThreads
    
The following default settings have now been set for you, courtesy of the bethini presets that ship with the list
   * These have been disabled by default `motion blur`, `godrays`, `lense flare`, and `depth of field`
   * `fBlendSplitDirShadow` - has been set to 0 on medium, 192 on high and ultra
   * `iDirShadowSplits` has been set to 1 on medium, set to 3 on high and ultra (3 is an expensive setting, but the shadows are seizure-inducing without it)
   * `fUpdateBudgetMS` - has been set to 2.4 (normally, messing with the budget settings will degrade performance, but because HighFPSPhysics is able to dynamically turn this down, this gives the scripting engine more resources, but only when it needs it)

#### Video Memory And ENBoost

* [Introduction to ENBoost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4cz-lFXDo8)
* [How to find your optimal value with ENBoost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSz84F1kgkM)
    - The following values are recommeneded for use with this list: 16384, 12288 and 8192
        * Higher values might work for users with a lot of ram, but are unnessary, for most users will actually reduce performance and stability
    - VRAM Size Test for DX11 is included in the list, can can be run through the mod organizer executable drop down- however most of the time it will lie to you about what your value should be. It frequently give values much higher than will work. If you experience instability (CTD, freezing, stuttering), test with the following values 16384, 12288 and 8192, one of them should work for you.

ENBoost is a feature of ENB that allows your FO4 to extend your system's VRAM with your regular RAM. It's not as fast, but it's better than nothing. AMD users with resizable BAR enabled should see even better performance improvements with this setting, and it's recommended to try it out. However this is a HIGHLY system specific setting. What works great for a user with a 3090, will crash for a user with less, which is why it's not turned on for you by default. Please note that updating the list will erase any changes made to enblocal.ini, so make a backup before updating.

If you have issues with textures not loading, stuttering, or the brown face bug, it is recommended to try this.

#### Nvidia/AMD Control Center

Settings here are going to be very system and driver specific, but some general things to be aware of
* VSync settings MUST be set to application controlled 
* Disable any framerate caps or limits
* Make sure your drivers are up to date.
* If you have FreeSync/Gsync enabled and an adaptive sync capable monitor, then you need either enable the 120 FPS NoVsync option in the customization section, or to make your own version of the HighFPSPhysicsFix configuration ini, to disable vsync and set the FPS cap to your desired value (however, due to the havok engine limitations, 60 or 120 is still recommended).

### In Game Setup
0. Start a new survival game (recommended, but not required)
1. Mod Configuration Menu - Recommended Optional Setting
    - Survival Configuration Menu (recommended)
        * turn ON savegame -> timed save
        * Turn off sleep healing
    - Sim Settlements 2 (optional)
        * Gameplay -> Resource Complexity to Scrap Categories (this will set SS2 to use a simplified scrap system of 4 scrap types, instead of requiring specific components, but instead of using items in your workbench, you will need to donate material at the city planner desk for your citizens to use them)
        * Gameplay -> Disease -> Settler disease off (this disables the optional settler disease mechanic, which is mostly just an annoying, extra level of management, but leave it on if you want).
    - Holotime (optional)
        * Turn status off, exit MCM, re-enter MCM, and turn status on
        * Show time -> off
        * Show timebar -> on
    - Immersive HUD
        * I personally don't use it, but have included it in the list for people who want it.

## Known Issues
- Performance Issues: Infinite Loading Screens, Micro Stuttering, Textures not loading, or the Brown Face bug: 
    1. Stop other processes to free up RAM, browser windows are especially a problem here
    2. Try setting the resolution to 1920x1080 if you're running above that
    3. Try enabling forceVideoMemory in installation folder > stock game > enblocal.ini
    4. Make sure you've set iNumHWThreads, as specified in the Bethini section of this readme.
- SS2 script failures on new game are the result of going through the opening sequence too quickly. After you finish character creation, wait for 30 seconds or so before exiting the bathroom.

## Crashlog Scanner

The list includes the [Buffout 4 Crashlog Auto Scanner](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/56255), found inside the tools folder. To use simply copy paste the crashlog from your `my documents/my games/fallout 4/f4se`, into the `tools/Scan Crash Logs Script` folder inside your LitR installation, and run `scan crashlogs.py`. See the readme.md in the same folder for information on how to interpret the results.
- The script will throw a lot of warnings in the `CHECKING FOR MODS THAT CAN CAUSE FREQUENT CRASHES...`. These can all be safely ignored, I have already dealt with all of them. You do not need to make any modifications to the mod list to deal with CTDs- these are almost always either random instability (which is expected in heavily modded FO4, but should be minimal), mis-configurations on the user end, or modifications that the user has made to the list.
 
## Notable Missing Mods
- Scrap Mods : I personally don't use them, and am not going to add something to the list I haven't test. I recommend SS2's city plans if you want more automation for settlement development.
- VAFS: I play the game on my couch, with an xbox controller, using VATS pretty much exclusively. If you want slow time aiming, take the sniper perk (which has a weak slow time effect), and stockpile JET.
- See Through Scopes: Because some weapons support this and other don't you end up with a different weapons having different control schemes, which is confusing. Players used to STS can add it back, with the replacer version and my [Lunar Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/61585) for it
- AWKCR - Yes, this is an AWKCR-free modlist. Faction Distribution Framework does have an ArmorKeywords dummy plugin it uses for some keywords, but it does not include any of the bloat or unexpected features of the full AWKCR mod.
- Beantown Interiors - It's a compatibility nightmare, both because it breaks precombines, and because it destroys the loot balance of the list
- CBBE- I find barbie doll proportions un-immersive, and annoying.
- Thuggysmurf (Depravity, Outcasts and Remnants, etc)- The quality of the work on these mods is incredible, but they are massively let down by the writing and choice to include adolescent jokes. I personally find a lot of it cringeworthy. A mod that adds a dildo as a weapon and has a bunch of female NPCs in skimpy sexy corsets isn't one I want in my load order.
 
## Unsupported Activities - Adding your own mods
### If you want to add stuff to the list, you do so at your own risk. You're on your own, but if you're really nice about it we'll offer advice in the discord.  If you choose to do so, there are a couple things to know.
0. The correct way (IMHO) to add stuff to an existing modlist, is to use the `[NODELETE]` tag, this will cause wabbajack to ignore it. New mods should be added near the END of the modlist, but BEFORE the plugins in the `Previs` sections, the whole point of adding a mod is to override the existing changes in the list, so at the end is *probably* where you want it. I recommend also adding a tag to order the mods you add alphabetically in the order you want, so that when you update the base list the folders will be added to the end, in the order you want them, and you just have to re-enable them, and then rerun the sorter patch. So, when you add a new mod, it will look like this in the left hand pane `[NODELETE] 01 Default Mod Name`. This allows you to apply critical updates from the main list, while keeping it relatively easy to maintain your additions. The `[NODELETE]` tag applies to any folder, including profiles. So if you want to do something more complex with load order, you can copy the existing profile, rename it and include the `[NODELETE]` tag at the start, and when the installer runs when you update it will leave your custom profile untouched.
1. Lunar Fallout Overhaul has a specific balance, adding new weapons, armors, monsters, or items is NOT RECOMMENDED. It probably won't break it, but it will screw with the balance, in most cases the weapon will be kinda useless due to the way lunar scales. If you want to patch it in, information on how the mod works and it's balance can be found on Moonracer's Lunar Fallout Overhaul mod page.
2. This modlist has a staggering amount of custom patching, and even completely custom mods, all with the vision of integrating everything together into a cohesive whole. The answer to "does this mod conflict with the Life in the Ruins" is almost always going to be yes, there are very few things that haven't been touched, tweaked, or reworked. If you don't know how to do conflict resolution in xedit, turn back now.
3. The mod uses M8r98a4f2's Complex Item Sorte v1.9, with 4estGimps Item Sorter Enhancements. The sorting plugin can be regenerated by running the script in xEdit (which is shipped with the modlist). When you run the script, it will ask you to activate the AWKCR addon- *DO NOT DO SO*. The AWKCR plugin in this list is NOT the normal AWKCR, and does not require special patching by the sorter.
4. As stated above, the AWKCR plugin in this list is NOT the normal AWKCR. AWKCR Dependent mods will not work with it.
5. This modlist includes custom precombines for the Downtown Boston, and Diamond City areas, as well as many interiors. If you break them or override them, it will destroy performance, and you will get flickering. To prevent this, all added mods should go above the precombine section.
