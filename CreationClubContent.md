## Repacking Creation Club Content
Using the creation club profile adds almost another 60 BA2s to the list, and will likely result in you hitting the BA2 limit (if your game crashes on load on the CC profile, but not on the normal profile, then that's probably the cause).

To repack the cc profile do the following
1. Go to the archive tab in MO2, extract all the creation club BSAs by right clicking on the [NODELETE] Creation Club Paint Jobs -> extract
2. Delete the BA2s from the mod folder for [NODELETE] Creation Club Paint Jobs
3. Right click on the puzzle icon -> BSA packer, pick any of the esps, click OK
4. you should now have just two large BA2 archives, instead of almost 60 small ones.
